//This script is used to make it easier to quickly run science experiments and crew reports,store the
//science in an "Experiment Storage Unit" (ESU) and reset the experiements.  Clearing all science is 
//useful if you have already run the experiment and have stored the science in the ESU.  "Collecting 
//all science" will not store duplicate science data, and for Science Bays and Goo Canisters it will 
//reset them so they can be run again.  It will delete science data on experiments that can be 
//repeatedly run, like thermometers.  This allows you to repeatedly press 1-2-3 to quickly run all 
//science experiments and gather all the data. I use this script while descending through an
//atmosphere so I can quickly get all the sceince at different altitudes and bioms.  I don't have to 
//click on each part or check to see if I've already got the data before running a goo or science bay.

//Requirements  - must have "Standard_Lib.ks" file in the same directory
//              - For option #2 to function, an Experiment Storage Unit part (ESU or "Science Box") on 
//                the ship. The program will inform you of this.  Options 1 and 3 will still function

run Standard_Lib.ks.
